    "To solve the problem, we will need the following data: \n",
    "*  New York City data containing the neighborhoods and boroughs.\n",
    "*  Latitude and longitude coordinates of those neighborhoods. This is required to plot the map and get the venue data.\n",
    "*  Venue data, particularly data related to restaurants. We are going to use this data to perform further analysis of the neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Source and Methods to extract them\n",

    "1. New York City data containing the neighborhoods and boroughs will be obtained from the open data source: https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset. \n",
    "2. Get the geographical coordinates of the neighborhoods (latitude and longitude) using Python Geocoder package. \n",
    "3. find the number of Japanese restaurants and rating of each restaurants in each neighborhoods.\n",
    "4. identify the location with more Japanese restaurants with better customer ratings. \n",
    "3. Foursquare API to get the venue data for the neighborhoods defined at the previous step. \n",
